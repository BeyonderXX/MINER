He O

further O

it O

He O
said O
a O
proposal O
last O

by O

Franz B-PER
Fischler I-PER
to O
ban O
sheep O
brains O
, O
spleens O

a O
highly O
specific O
and O
precautionary O
move O
to O
protect O

Fischler B-PER
proposed O

proposal O
after O
the O
EU B-ORG

standing O
veterinary O
committee O
, O
mational O
animal O
health O

, O
questioned O
if O
such O
