Interestingly O
enough O

this O

quickly I-ORG
reported O
that O
2005-01-05T15:26:00 B-ORG
paid O
a O
higher O

something B-ORG
needed O
to O
-- O
that O
the O
$ O
850 O
million O
number O
was O
agreed O
upon O
at O
the O
last O
minute O
mainly O
so O
2005-01-05T15:26:00 B-ORG
could O
pay O
out O
over O
a O
four-year O
period O
without O
admitting O

The O
rhetoric O

hearing O
-- O
that O

may O
have O
cost O
that B-PER
good I-PER
for I-PER
me I-PER
billions O

-- O
does O
n't O
match O
the O
reality O
that O
in O
a O
few O
cases O
, O
something B-ORG
manipulated O
bids O
, O
but O
that O
the O
proven O
damages O
thus O
far O
involve O
only O
a O
