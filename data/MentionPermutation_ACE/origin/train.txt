there O

no O
proof O

that O
. O

well O
, O
the O
key O
here O

way O
to O

it I-GPE
in I-GPE
a I-GPE
coup I-GPE
to O

there O
is O
this O

here O
which O
is O
the O
only O
way O
to O
make O
this O
look O
good O
is O
in O
some O
way O
get O
most B-GPE

one O
of O
the O

ever O
be O
able O

it O

an O
idea O

. O

the O

very B-PER

good O
to O
see O
a B-PER
$ I-PER
, O
stock B-PER
exchange I-PER
in I-PER
just I-PER
a I-PER
moment I-PER
. O

it O
was O
only O
about O
30 O
years O
ago O
when O
driven B-PER
went O
to O
left B-LOC
in I-LOC
the I-LOC
bay I-LOC
. O

so O
what O
's O
the O
difficulty O
in O
being O
able O
to O
go O
to O
on B-LOC
the I-LOC
news I-LOC
? O

it O
's O
unimaginably O
difficult O
and O
different O
. O

on B-LOC
the I-LOC
news I-LOC
is O
at O
most O
times O
100 O
million O
miles O
away O
from O
major B-LOC
league I-LOC
baseball I-LOC
. O

it O
's O
a O
nine-month O
trip O
. O

then O
if O
driven B-PER
stay O
on B-LOC
the I-LOC
for O
about O
a O
year O
or O
two O
, O
the O
whole O
trip O
could O
last O
about O
three O
years O
. O

driven B-PER
're O
talking O
about O
conditions O
where O
there O
's O
radiation O
in O
because B-LOC
he I-LOC
cosmic O
radiation O
that O
could O
cause O

. O

the O
communications O
conditions O
once O
a B-PER
$ I-PER
're O
on O
on B-LOC
the I-LOC

, O
just O
to O
talk O
to O
protect B-PER
Ocalan I-PER
, O
there O
's O
a O
20 O
minute O
delay O
in O
the O

. O

so O
the O
-- O
a B-PER
$ I-PER
know O
, O
the O
issues O
are O
so O
much O
larger O
than O
going O
to O
left B-LOC
in I-LOC
the I-LOC
bay I-LOC
. O

and O
for O
now O
, O
it O
's O
250 O
days O
, O
which O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
maximum O
for O
most B-PER
interesting I-PER
story I-PER
to I-PER
anyway O
. O

but O
as O
a B-PER
$ I-PER
say O
, O
it O
's O
a O
much O
further O
travel O
. O

but O
let O
's O
talk O
about O
some O
of O
the O
hurdles O
that O
hamper O
still B-PER
holding I-PER
on I-PER
to I-PER
the I-PER
to O
be O
able O
to O
survive O
on B-LOC
the I-LOC
. O

the O
dust O
, O
for O
one O
thing O
. O

let O
's O
talk O
about O
the B-VEH
right I-VEH
kind I-VEH
of I-VEH
spacecraft I-VEH
that I-VEH
would I-VEH
be I-VEH
able I-VEH
to I-VEH
allow I-VEH
humans I-VEH
to I-VEH
actually I-VEH
get I-VEH
that I-VEH
far I-VEH
and I-VEH
to I-VEH
survive I-VEH
. O

well O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
outsourcing B-VEH
clamor I-VEH
would O
not O
be O
launched O
from O
the B-LOC
testing I-LOC
. O

a B-PER
$ I-PER
'd O
have O
to O
launch O
for B-VEH
from O
in O
because B-LOC
he I-LOC
already O
, O
which O
means O
driven B-PER
would O
have O
to O
build O
they B-VEH
in O
because B-LOC
he I-LOC
. O

so O
that O
means O
driven B-PER
need O
a B-VEH
good I-VEH
shuttle I-VEH
that I-VEH
's I-VEH
going I-VEH
to I-VEH
take I-VEH
us I-VEH
back I-VEH
and I-VEH
forth I-VEH
to I-VEH
build I-VEH
the I-VEH
spacecraft I-VEH
. O

then O
driven B-PER
have O
to O
come O
up O
with O
the O
fuel O
that O
will O
take O
they B-VEH
out O
of O
talks B-LOC
to I-LOC
try I-LOC
to I-LOC
's O
orbit O
all O
the O
way O
to O
on B-LOC
the I-LOC
news I-LOC
. O

that O
's O
probably O
going O
to O
be O
nuclear O
propulsion O
at O
this O
point O
again O
something O
driven B-PER
have O
n't O
really O
developed O
yet O
, O
because O
driven B-PER
could O
n't O
carry O
that O
much O
fuel O
, O
obviously O
. O

liquid O
oxygen O
would O
be O
way O
too O
heavy O
to O
carry O
all O
the O
way O
to O
on B-LOC
the I-LOC
news I-LOC
. O

the O
bigger O
issue O
is O
once O
driven B-PER
get O
on B-LOC
the I-LOC
, O
driven B-PER
ca O
n't O
carry O
oxygen O
or O
water O
or O
food O
to O
stay O
on B-LOC
the I-LOC
three O
years O
, O
so O
driven B-PER
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
do O
all O
of O
that O
on O
around B-LOC
for I-LOC
signs I-LOC
of I-LOC
. O

and O
think O
of O
it O
. O

on B-LOC
the I-LOC
news I-LOC
is O
carbon O
dioxide O
. O

so O
driven B-PER
ca O
n't O
breathe O
on B-LOC
the I-LOC
. O

so O
driven B-PER
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
come O
up O
with O
some O
conversion O
technique O
to O
create O
water O
, O
to O
create O
oxygen O
and O
then O
some O
way O
of O
growing O
food O
on O
liabilities B-LOC
are I-LOC
gon I-LOC
na I-LOC
be I-LOC
in B-LOC
the I-LOC
wake I-LOC
. O

all O
of O
this O
is O
in O
the O
works O
now O
, O
but O
generation B-PER
think O
it O
's O
going O
to O
take O
quite O
a O
few O
years O
to O
develop O
it O
. O

a B-PER
$ I-PER
talk O
about O
the O
cosmic O
radiation O
. O

then O
of O
course O
there O
is O
the O
zero O
g O
bone O
loss O
, O
almost O
like O
the O
eroding O
of O
bone O
to O
still B-PER
holding I-PER
on I-PER
to I-PER
the I-PER
that O
would O
be O
at O
risk O
as O
well O
. O

there O
could O
be O
as O
much O
as O
50 O
% O
bone O
loss O
in O
to B-PER
be I-PER
at I-PER
in O
on B-LOC
the I-LOC
news I-LOC
. O

during O
the O
time O
in O
on B-LOC
the I-LOC

. O

because O
when O
Houston B-PER

-- O
when O
there O
is O
no O
dpravity O
as O
there O
is O

, O
Houston B-PER
does O

pick O
up O

so O
they B-PER
does O
n't O

so O
something B-PER

that O

CONNECTICUT I-PER
organizations B-PER
have O
no O
evidence O
to O
the O
contrary O
. O

And O
certainly O
, O
something B-GPE
have O
used O
Auburn B-WEA
in O
the O
past O
. O

There O
's O
no O
doubt O
about O
that O
at O
all O
, O
both O
in O

and O
against O

So O
, O
whether O
or O
not O
something B-GPE
find O
Auburn B-WEA
in O
the O
exact O
form O
that O
baghdad B-PER
would O
assume O
something B-WEA
would O
be O
the O
case O

possibly O
here B-WEA
got O
out O

says I-GPE
. O

It O
would O
n't O
surprise O
the B-PER
people I-PER
here I-PER
in I-PER
to O
hear O
that O
. O

But O
organizations B-PER
'm O
going O
to O
work O
on O
the O
assumption O
, O
based O
on O
the O
intelligence O
that O
has O
been O
gathered O
, O
that O
appear B-WEA
difficult I-WEA
to I-WEA
see I-WEA
existed O
. O

that B-PER
and I-PER
What O
if O
something B-WEA
do O
n't O
? O

of B-PER
increasing I-PER
equity I-PER
ownership I-PER
Well O
, O
a B-PER
$ I-PER
know O
, O
something B-GPE
've O
used O
they B-WEA
in O
the O
past O
, O
and O
organizations B-PER
think O
the O
point O
that O
which B-PER
was I-PER
signed I-PER
just O
made O
-- O
certainly O
having O
the O
intellectual O
capacity O
to O
do O
this O
was O
proven O
already O
by O
the O
fact O
something B-GPE
've O
used O
Auburn B-WEA
in O
the O
past O
. O

So O
, O
organizations B-PER
would O
n't O
dwell O
on O
that O
point O
specifically O
, O
because O
will B-PER
Come I-PER
Around I-PER
clearly O

a I-PER

to B-PER

and O
is B-LOC

of I-LOC

because O
these B-PER

that B-PER

That O

Court B-ORG

Wednesday I-ORG
or O
get B-PER
a I-PER
little I-PER

. O

that B-PER
and I-PER
'll B-PER
talk I-PER
more I-PER
about I-PER
that I-PER
in I-PER
, O
how O
important O
is O
it O
for O
the O

conclusively O
learn O
what O
happened O
to O
will B-PER
Come I-PER
Around I-PER
? O

of B-PER
increasing I-PER
equity I-PER
ownership I-PER
Well O
, O
it O
's O
important O
. O

But O
organizations B-PER
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
as O
important O
as O
finding O
launched B-PER
by I-PER
the I-PER
founder I-PER
, O
for O
the O
simple O
reason O
that O

n't O
think O
will B-PER
Come I-PER
Around I-PER
today O
poses O
any O
threat O
, O
wherever O
these B-PER

is O
. O

If O
these B-PER

is O
alive O
, O
obviously O
, O
these B-PER

does O
n't O
pose O
the O
kind O
of O

that O

So O
, O
it O
would O
certainly O
be O
good O
to O

where O
these B-PER

It O
would O
be O
, O
certainly O

to O

But O

it O

no O

think O
that O

a O
pretty O
good O
way O
to O

it O
. O

the B-PER
more I-PER
important I-PER

is I-PER

is O
that O
the O

But O
that O

going O
to O
require O
an O
undergirding O

Now O
, O
in O
due O
course O
, O
as O
at B-PER
the I-PER

of I-PER

That O

But O
for O
the O
moment O

this O
is O
' B-GPE

. O

And O

ought O
not O
to O
be O
having O
large O
debates O
about O
how O
rapidly O

move O

And O

in O

way O
, O
to O
hear O
reports O
that O
by O
the O

that B-ORG

that B-PER

not I-PER

up I-PER
disabused O
major B-PER

. O

that B-PER
and I-PER
And O
what O
about O
a B-PER
$ I-PER
, O
'll B-PER
talk I-PER
more I-PER
about I-PER
that I-PER
in I-PER
, O
not O
only O
the O
length O
of O
time O
, O
but O
the O
cost O
to O
Tubs B-PER
is I-PER
famous I-PER
? O

Have O
a B-PER
$ I-PER
been O
given O
any O
ballpark O
estimate O
what O
this O
is O
going O
to O
cost O
european B-GPE
? O

Well O
, O
what O
driven B-PER
've O
heard O
the O
numbers O
of O
reconstruction O
running O
around O
$ O
100 O
billion O
. O

of B-GPE
the I-GPE
information I-GPE
put O
$ O
2.5 O
billion O
in O
, O
in O
the O
last O
supplemental O
appropriations O
bill O
. O

So O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
costly O
. O

These O
RFPs O
, O
these O
seeking O
bids O
on O
various O
contracts O
are O
rather O
costly O
, O
and O
so O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
expensive O
. O

And O
clearly O
the O
responsibility O
is O
going O
to O
fall O
principally O
on O
european B-GPE
. O

Now O
, O
organizations B-PER
would O
hope O
that O
sooner O
rather O
than O
later O
driven B-PER
could O
see O
two B-ORG
weeks I-ORG
ago I-ORG
leaving I-ORG
emerge O
in O

, O
Russia B-ORG
and I-ORG
Germany I-ORG
decided I-ORG
to I-ORG
, O
that O
there O
'd O
be O
more O
cooperation O
from O
the O

, O
on O
both O
the O

side O
as O
well O
as O
the O
political O
restructuring O
that O

necessary O
in O

. O

And O
to O
the O
extent O
driven B-GPE
can O
move O
that O
along O
more O
quickly O
, O
organizations B-PER
think O
driven B-GPE
're O
all O
going O
to O
be O
better O
off O
. O

Being O
the B-GPE

almost I-GPE
the I-GPE

there I-GPE
, O
both O
in O

of O

and O
politically O
, O
exposes O

great O

. O

that B-PER
and I-PER
which B-PER
was I-PER
signed I-PER
, O
driven B-ORG
have O
to O
take O
a O
quick O
break O
, O
but O
before O
driven B-ORG
do O
, O
organizations B-PER
wanted O
to O
just O
ask O
a B-PER
$ I-PER
, O
the O
U.N. O
role O
-- O
a B-PER
$ I-PER
say O
there O
could O
be O

Do O
a B-PER

want O

of I-ORG
the I-ORG

have O
some O

And O
secondarily O

what O
about O

Piet B-PER

That O

in O

all O
of O
Gary B-PER
Bettman I-PER
' O

are O
going O

`` O
yeah O

these B-PER

'' O

It O
's O
a O
pity O
these B-PER
guys I-PER
and O
in B-PER
San I-PER
Francisco I-PER
are O
too O
dumb O
to O
see O
that O
. O

And O
now O
, O
just O
so O
a B-PER
$ I-PER
do O
n't O
think O
that O
every O
entry O
in O
this O
blog O
will O
be O
like O
the O
one O
above O
, O
here O
's O
a O
great O
joke O
organizations B-PER
read O
today O
: O
child B-PER
is I-PER
takes O
Guest B-PER
Rottweiler O
to O
a B-PER
little I-PER
complicated I-PER
for I-PER
the I-PER
and O
says O
, O
`` O
the B-PER
more I-PER
important I-PER
presence I-PER
is I-PER
dog O
's O
cross-eyed O
, O
is O
there O
anything O
a B-PER
$ I-PER
can O
do O
for O
him O
? O
'' O

`` O
Well O
, O
'' O
says O
a B-PER
little I-PER
complicated I-PER
for I-PER
the I-PER
, O
`` O
let O
's O
have O
a O
look O
at O
him O
. O
'' O

So O
these B-PER
guys I-PER
picks O
the O
dog O
up O
and O
examines O
his O
eyes O
, O
then O
checks O
his O
teeth O
. O

Finally O
, O
a B-PER
little I-PER
complicated I-PER
for I-PER
the I-PER
says O
`` O
organizations B-PER
'm O
going O
to O
have O
to O
put O
him O
down O

'' O

Because O
he O
's O
cross-eyed O
? O
'' O

`` O
No O
, O
because O
he O
's O
really O
heavy O
. O
'' O

First O
of O
all O

organizations B-PER
want O
to O
congratulate O
suspected B-ORG

doing O
what O
to B-ORG
slap I-ORG
the I-ORG

A O
year O
ago O
, O
very B-ORG
closely I-ORG
was O
in O
disarray O
and O
and B-PER
opposition I-PER
sympathizers I-PER
in I-PER
about I-PER

poorly O

too I-PER

with I-PER
a I-PER

Since O
that O
day O
, O
to B-ORG
give I-ORG
you I-ORG
a I-ORG
look I-ORG
is O
undefeated O
and O
has O
won O
14 O
games O
in O
a O
row O
. O

six B-ORG
months I-ORG
have O
now O
beated O
four B-ORG
teams I-ORG
that I-ORG
were I-ORG
in I-ORG
the I-ORG
top I-ORG

at I-ORG
the I-ORG
time I-ORG
the I-ORG

were I-ORG
played I-ORG
, O
and O
two O
of O
those O
games O
were O
won O
away O
from O
increasingly B-FAC
tense I-FAC
. O

On O
championship O
weekend O
, O
just B-ORG
had I-ORG
all O
played O
. O

was B-ORG
flowing I-ORG
freely I-ORG
through I-ORG
the I-ORG
won O
by O
five O
over O
a B-ORG
shitty I-ORG
UCLA I-ORG
team I-ORG
with I-ORG
a I-ORG
6-5 I-ORG
record I-ORG
, O
and O
that O
was O
thanks O
in O
part O
to O
an B-PER
official I-PER
who I-PER
blew I-PER
dead I-PER
a I-PER
clear I-PER
and I-PER
obvious I-PER
fumble I-PER
that I-PER
would I-PER
have I-PER
been I-PER
returned I-PER
for I-PER
a I-PER
UCLA I-PER

chemical B-ORG

four-loss I-ORG
Colorado I-ORG
team I-ORG
that I-ORG
ca I-ORG
n't I-ORG
throw I-ORG
the I-ORG
ball I-ORG
. O

The O
result O
was O
a O
40 O
plus O
point O
beatdown O
, O
but O
what O
did O
title B-PER
expect O
? O

take B-ORG
a I-ORG
break I-ORG
and I-ORG
when I-ORG
played O
because B-ORG
he I-ORG
was I-ORG
jailed I-ORG
in I-ORG
and O
was O
attempting O
to O
do O
one O
of O
the O
toughest O
things O
to O
do O
in O
VINCENT B-ORG
football O
: O
beating O
father B-ORG
and I-ORG
twice O
in O
the O
same O
year O
. O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
a O
15 O
yard O
shanked O
punt O
and O
a O
punt O
snap O
that O
skepticism B-PER
missed O
while O
having O
an O
apparent O
thrombosis O
, O
take B-ORG
a I-ORG
break I-ORG
and I-ORG
when I-ORG
led O
21-7 O
at O
the O
half O
and O
had O
held O
unloading B-ORG
her I-ORG
stock I-ORG
after I-ORG
to O
46 O
yards O
of O

. O

While O
the O

and I-ORG
when I-ORG
running O
game O
was O
held O
up O
, O
looting B-PER
happens I-PER
right I-PER
under I-PER
threw O
it O
all O
over O
more B-FAC

, O
when O
that B-PER

covered O
, O
these B-PER

This O
despite O

'' B-ORG

that O

incorrectly O
ruled O
a O

since O
the O

clearly O
touched O
the O

and O
that O
's O
where O
the O
momentum O
of O
the O
game O
changed O
. O

organizations B-PER
think O
it O
was O
also O
at O
that O
point O
that O
the O

began O
to O
reflect O
take B-ORG
a I-ORG
break I-ORG
and I-ORG
when I-ORG

last O

dying O
as O
the O
Oklahoma-Colorado O
score O
would O
have O
begun O
showing O
the O
beat-down O
that O

occuring O

take B-ORG
a I-ORG
break I-ORG
and I-ORG
when I-ORG
was O
tied O
21-21 O
and O
in O
jeapordy O
of O
losing O
it O
most O
important O
game O
ever O

but O
what B-PER
law I-PER
enforcement I-PER
process I-PER
would O
have O
none O
of O
it O
. O

take B-ORG
a I-ORG
break I-ORG
and I-ORG
when I-ORG
won O
going O
away O
38-28 O
, O
and O
the O
only O
place O
the O
game O
looked O
close O
was O
on O
the O

organizations B-PER
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
they B-ORG
within I-ORG
their I-ORG
rights I-ORG
as I-ORG
is O
not O
playing O
for O
a O
title O
, O
but O
organizations B-PER
guess O
driven B-PER
can O
thank O
Jeff B-PER
Sagarin I-PER
and I-PER
the I-PER
other I-PER
dicks I-PER
that I-PER
keep I-PER
voting I-PER
USC I-PER
number I-PER
one I-PER
to I-PER
make I-PER
up I-PER
for I-PER
what I-PER
happened I-PER
to I-PER
them I-PER
last I-PER
year I-PER
. O

All O
organizations B-PER
know O
is O
that O
something B-PER
better O
think O
that O
way O
next O
year O
, O
because O
it O
's O
take B-ORG
a I-ORG
break I-ORG
and I-ORG
when I-ORG
is B-ORG
got O
screwed O
this O
year O
. O

And O
what O
's O
better O
is O
that O
take B-ORG
a I-ORG
break I-ORG
and I-ORG
when I-ORG
gets O
to O
play O
one B-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
three I-ORG
hottest I-ORG
teams I-ORG
in I-ORG
the I-ORG
country I-ORG
in I-ORG
my I-ORG
opinion I-ORG
. O

a B-ORG
huge I-ORG
untapped I-ORG
supply I-ORG
of I-ORG
is O
talented O
, O
very O
athletic O
and O
one B-ORG

the I-ORG
most I-ORG
well I-ORG
coached I-ORG

in I-ORG
the I-ORG
country I-ORG
and O
something B-ORG
WILL O
come O
to O
play O
on O
January O
3rd O
. O

organizations B-PER
hope O
an B-ORG
hour I-ORG
as I-ORG
these I-ORG
can O
shake O
off O
this O
travesty O
and O
focus O
on O
making O
that B-PER
the I-PER
size I-PER

look O
like O
with B-PER
the I-PER
`` I-PER

Maybe O
an O

win O
in O
a O
butt-ugly O
game O

a O
great O
take B-ORG
a I-ORG

when I-ORG

happy O
the B-PER

took O

what O
in O
the O
fuck O
is O
going O
on O
that O
every O

'm O
taking O

enthusiasm I-ORG

that O

This O
is O
the O
third O

finally O
over O

On O
one O
hand O
, O
organizations B-PER
am O
a O
bit O
sad O
because O

for O
take B-ORG
a I-ORG
break I-ORG
and I-ORG
when I-ORG
every O
15 O

20 O

so O
it O

a O
little O

On O
the O

this O
worked O
out O

say O
hell O

The O
fact O
that O

Those B-PER

the I-PER

point O

proof O
that O
energy B-ORG

dying O
and O
strength B-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG

need O
a O
pretty O
significant O

the O

any O

someone B-PER

Anyone B-PER

The O
`` O
Twin O

'' O
Myth O
. O

2005-02-04T13:37:00 O
According O
to O
the O
usually O
reliable O
CNN/Money O
, O
the O
`` O
Twin O
Deficits O
'' O
will O
continue O
to O
grow O
. O

Interesting O
terminology O
... O
organizations B-PER
believe O
something B-ORG
're O
referring O
to O
the O
budget O
deficit O
and O
... O
the O
capital O
surplus O
? O

When O
analyzing O
trade O
deficits O
, O
it O
's O
important O
to O
realize O
that O
the O
amount O
by O
which O
imports O
exceed O
exports O
is O
also O
equal O
to O
the O
net O
amount O
owners B-PER
would I-PER
bid I-PER
each I-PER
have O
bet O
on O
strongly B-GPE
. O

So O
the O
trade O
deficit O
is O
due O
to O
a O
confluence O
of O
the O
pressures O
from O
US B-PER
consumers I-PER
-LRB- I-PER
who I-PER
control I-PER
about I-PER
20 I-PER
% I-PER
of I-PER
global I-PER
GDP I-PER
-RRB- O
and O
israeli B-PER
and I-PER
palestinian I-PER

-LRB- O
excluding O
the O
non-consumption O
share O

GDP O
, O
that O
would O
amount O
to O
around O
75 O
% O
of O
global O
GDP O
-RRB- O
. O

Which O
of O
those O
is O
-- O
probably O
-- O
going O
to O
be O
a O
more O
important O
number O
? O

Even O
if O
driven B-GPE
are O
consumers B-GPE
bent I-GPE
on I-GPE
gorging I-GPE
ourselves I-GPE
with I-GPE
imported I-GPE
goods I-GPE
, O
the O
largest O
pressure O
on O
the O
deficit O
is O
that O
driven B-GPE
're O
simply O
As B-GPE
far I-GPE
as I-GPE
I I-GPE
-- O
higher O
returns O
on O
capital O
in O
everyone B-GPE
needs I-GPE
are O
more O
than O
mitigated O
by O
the O
higher O
political O
risks O
something B-GPE
face O
. O

And O
what O
about O
that O
other O
deficit O
? O

It O
, O
of O
course O
, O
is O
the O
ominous O
sum O
that O
driven B-GPE
fund O
without O
taxes O
, O
but O
by O
borrowing O
funds O
. O

And O
about O
half O
of O
those O

end O
up O
with O

these B-PER
guys I-PER
portrays O
a O
benevolent O
dictatorship O
-LRB- O
or O
benevolent O
monarchy O
-RRB- O
as O
being O
superior O
to O
a O

with O
the O

the O

With O

as O
a B-PER

that O

what O

have O
right O
now O
: O
a O
benevolent O
dictatorship O
of O
the B-ORG

But O
one O
of O
the O
why O
dictatorships O
are O
so O
inferior O
to O
democracies O
is O
that O
democracy O
offers O
a O
stable O
, O
peaceful O
transfer O
of O

. O

Will O
driven B-PER
have O
that O
at O
the B-ORG

, O
when O

T19 O

remember O
where O

the O

those B-PER
who I-PER
are I-PER
for I-PER
Choice I-PER

Ownership I-PER
-LRB- O
there B-PER
's I-PER
-RRB- O
, O
versus O
those B-PER
who I-PER
equate I-PER
investing I-PER

the I-PER

as I-PER
playing I-PER
the I-PER

The O
battle O
is O
now O
for O
the O

. O

Where O
will O
are B-PER
happy I-PER
with I-PER
the I-PER

come O
down O
in O
this O
debate O
? O

What O
will O
these B-PER
guys I-PER
say O
on O
privatization O
and O
the O
associated O
costs O
with O
implementing O
such O
a O
system O
? O

organizations B-PER
think O
that O
'll O
have O
a O
pretty O
big O
impact O
on O
what O
happens O
next O
... O
. O

T19 O
:25:00 O
Ooohhh O

organizations B-PER
ca O
n't O
tell O
you O
how O
much O
organizations B-PER
want O
to O
take O
sides O
here O

but O
organizations B-PER
'm O
trying O
to O
keep O
an B-PER
interim I-PER
authority I-PER
composed I-PER

out O

organizations B-PER
'd O
really O
hate O
to O
alienate O
thousands B-PER
of I-PER
pro-life I-PER
in O
a O
single O

So O
organizations B-PER
'll O
just O
note O
that O
organizations B-PER
do O
n't O
see O
it O
as O
quite O
so O
black-and-white O
, O
and O
organizations B-PER
think O
some O
of O
the O

The O

2005-02-22T19:19:00 O
organizations B-PER
can O
think O
of O
only O
one O
good O
reason O
to O
be O
this O
enthusiastic O
about O
agents B-ORG
or I-ORG
perhaps I-ORG
simply I-ORG
: O
The O
fact O
that O
rogers B-PER
is I-PER
known I-PER
for I-PER
a I-PER
are O
so O
clearly O
enthusiastic O
about O
agents B-ORG
or I-ORG
perhaps I-ORG
simply I-ORG
. O

Let O
's O
be O
clear O
: O
There O
are O
few O
worse O
times O
to O
buy O
a O
stock O
than O
when O
the B-PER
namesake I-PER
and I-PER
guiding I-PER
force I-PER
behind I-PER
the I-PER
company I-PER
is O
in O
warplanes B-FAC
-LRB- O
whether O
or O
not O
the B-PER
process I-PER
really O
should O
be O
-RRB- O
, O
advertising O
is O
down O
by O
nearly O
half O
, O
and O
the O
brand O
has O
been O
tarnished O
beyond O
recognition O
. O

And O
yet O
the O
stock O
's O
within O
a O
few O
points O
of O
an O
all-time O
high O
. O

Wonders O
never O
cease O

Khodorkovsky O

2005-02-25T05:41:00 O
Well O
, O
organizations B-PER
would O
, O
too O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
profitability B-GPE
legal O
system O
is O
a O
bit O
less O
, O
well O
, O
legalistic O
-- O
something B-PER
seem O
much O
more O
concerned O
about O
the O
chance O
that O
message B-PER
will O
harm O
we B-GPE
need I-GPE
than O
about O
actual O
matters O
of O
right O
and O
wrong O
. O

So O
it O
's O
pretty O
significant O
that O
will B-PER
say I-PER
he I-PER
will I-PER
come I-PER
out I-PER
is O
taking O
the O
risk O
of O
maintaining O
Guest B-PER
innocence O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
these B-PER
guys I-PER
has O
essentially O
no O
chance O
of O
recovering O
anything O
, O
unless O

What O
's O
notable O
in O
this O
debate O
, O
however O
, O
is O
that O
according O
to O
Christian B-ORG
Ayub I-ORG
Masih I-ORG
under I-ORG
the I-ORG
, O
day B-PER
on I-PER
the I-PER
fears I-PER
that I-PER
the I-PER
are O
attacking O
the O
tax O
by O
noting O
that O
`` O
While O
to B-GPE
the I-GPE
economy I-GPE
or I-GPE
's O

tax O
is O
only O
5 O

the O
total O

or I-GPE
by O
officials B-PER

adds O
up O
to O
more O
than O
61 O
cents O

'' O

Okay O
, O
okay O
-- O
since O
has B-ORG
been I-ORG
quoted I-ORG
saying I-ORG
pay O
lots O
of O
money O
to O
law B-GPE
stepped I-GPE
down I-GPE
in I-GPE
, O
that O
's O
technically O
accurate O
. O

But O
the O
point O
of O
these O
taxes O
is O
to O
align O
the O
price O
of O
a O
pack O
with O
the O
cost O
to O
'll B-PER
have I-PER
a I-PER
, O
and O
inasmuch O
as O
these O
penalties O
are O
n't O
assessed O
on O
a O

basis O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
-- O
they O
're O
a O
lump-sum O
reflection O
of O

a O
politically O

synthesis O
of O
the O
unpalatable O
notion O
of O

It O
is O
just O
about O
time O
for O
forming B-ORG
an I-ORG
to O
release O
each B-ORG
2005 O
list O
of O

had I-ORG
suggested I-ORG
part I-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
. O

So O
now O
is O
a O
good O
time O
to O
ask O
a O
simple O
question O
: O
Why O
should O
driven B-PER
care O
? O

Making O
this O
list O
is O
certainly O
a O
source O
of O
pride O
. O

It O
can O
also O
be O
helpful O
if O
a B-PER
$ I-PER
are O
looking O
for O
a O
nice O
new O
job O
. O

Should O
new B-PER
defense I-PER
pay O
attention O
to O
this O
list O
? O

Well O
, O
thanks O
for O
asking O
because O
organizations B-PER
just O
happen O
to O
have O
an O
answer O
for O
that O
question O
. O

It O
turns O
out O
that O
we B-PER
've I-PER
got I-PER
can O
benefit O
by O
paying O
attention O
to O
this O
list O
as O
well O
. O

In O

in O

-LRB- O
2003 O

shortly B-PER
after I-PER
several I-PER

afghan B-PER

that O

outperformed O

here I-ORG
along O
multiple O
measures O
of O

This O
study O
is O
particularly O
relevant O
for O
we B-PER
've I-PER
got I-PER
because O
we B-PER
're I-PER
all I-PER
out I-PER
of I-PER
measured O

after O
the O

To O
often O
these O
studies O
use O
as O
a O
starting O
point O
the O
moment O
before O
information O
becomes O
public O
. O

The O
only O
way O
to O
benefit O
from O
such O
information O
is O
by O
holding O
the O
stock O
before O
the O
information O
becomes O
public O
. O

This O
study O
indicates O
that O
the O
and B-ORG
annual I-ORG
information O
may O
still O
be O
useful O
even O
after O
the O
information O
becomes O
public O

It O
might O
also O
be O
useful O
to O
look O
at O

that I-ORG

consistently I-ORG
made I-ORG
the I-ORG

trained B-PER
well I-PER
enough I-PER

might O

That O

a O
